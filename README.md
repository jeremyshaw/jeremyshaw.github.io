This is the repo for my jeremyshaw.github.io website.

The website's purpose is to serve as a portfolio website for some of the more impactful parts of my Computer Engineering related work. Hopefully, more of my hobby projects will be put up here. I did not initially realize they were worth documenting, but after someone asked for a copy of my fan duct, I recognized I should improve the behind-the-scenes documentation a bit.

p.s. Thanks for finding this backend README.md!
